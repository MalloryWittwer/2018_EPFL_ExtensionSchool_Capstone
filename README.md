This is an archive of my "Capsone project" on ML-based prediction of material shaders, completed in 2018 during my "Data Science and Machine Learning"
program from EPFL's Extension School.

The program was designed to convert a phone picture of a real material surface - like wood, concrete, plastic, metals, etc. - into a digital 
equivalent of that material, which could be used in computer graphics or 3D animation projects. In computer graphics, these materials are 
parametrized by a vector of values representing things like "base color", "reflectivity", "roughness" etc. which were targets of my CNN. 
To create a training set, I used the 3D software Blender and simulated thousands of different material surfaces. I then took "simulated pictures" 
of them and trained an AI on this synthetic data. I studied how the model could generalize to pictures of real materials.

Overall, I remember having a lot of fun with this project. Now, almost 3 years after, my coding skills have improved a lot and I would approach 
the problem slightly differently. If I find the time, I may want to rejuvenate this project in the future as the basic idea is still worthwile!

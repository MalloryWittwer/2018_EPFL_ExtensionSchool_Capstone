My "Capsone project" on ML-based prediction of material shaders, completed in 2018 during my "Data Science and Machine Learning"
program from EPFL's Extension School. For a refreshed version of this project, go to the [capstone_refreshed](https://github.com/MalloryWittwer/2018_EPFL_ExtensionSchool_Capstone/tree/capstone_refreshed) branch.
